# ``FitHeightSheet``

FitHeightSheet lets you present a sheet with a dynamic height based on its content..

## Overview

The `fitHeightSheet` view modifire allows you to present a sheet that dynamically adjusts its height based on the content it contains. This is particularly useful when the content does not need to scroll and you want a more compact and visually appealing presentation. While the `FitHeightSheet` package is not intended to replace the native SwiftUI sheet, it complements it by addressing specific use cases where a content-fitted sheet is more appropriate.
